I am a CBB (Computational Biology & Bioinformatics) PhD student at Yale University. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Yuval Kluger](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/kluger/) and [Prof. Rong Fan](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/rong-fan). Before my PhD, I earned BS degree in Integrated Science from Peking University, focusing on applied math and biology. During my undergraduate, I did research in [Lin lab](http://www.thelinlab.org/index.html) at Peking University and worked as a research intern in [van Dijk lab](https://www.vandijklab.org) at Yale University.

My research interests lie in the area of machine learning, causal inference, and their various applications in single-cell omics data.
